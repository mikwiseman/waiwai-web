        <p>Ak Bars Bank together with WaiWai became a laureate of the "AI Olympus" artificial intelligence award in the "New Digital Idea of the Year" nomination. The awards ceremony took place in Moscow.</p>
<p>The award was given for the successful implementation of an AI agent in the bank's recruitment process. The project started in 2024 and is aimed at automating the hiring of specialists in rare professions.</p>
<p>"AI Olympus" is an annual Russian award in the field of artificial intelligence that recognizes significant achievements and innovative projects in the AI sphere. The award is organized by the Digital Leaders team.</p>

<h2>How the System Works</h2>
<p>The WaiWai AI agent integrates with HeadHunter and other platforms to search and establish business contacts. Based on given vacancy criteria, the system finds suitable candidates, analyzes their profiles, and communicates with each applicant taking into account their experience, skills, and interests.</p>
<p>For mass vacancies, such as call center operators, where one position receives over 1,000 applications, the system automatically sorts incoming applications, ranks them by relevance, and responds to applicants, significantly reducing the workload on recruiters.</p>
<p>"AI agents give recruiters superpowers - now every recruitment specialist can work like Sherlock Holmes: instantly analyze thousands of candidates, find hidden talent, and accurately determine who is perfect for the vacancy," says WaiWai CEO Mik Weisman. "This is the future that has already arrived. Thanks to AI agents, people get the privilege of working only on interesting tasks, leaving the routine to artificial intelligence."</p>
<h2>Project Results</h2>
<p>With the implementation of the AI agent, Ak Bars Bank managed to reduce vacancy closing time by 61%, and 48% of recruiters' time was freed up for other tasks.</p>
