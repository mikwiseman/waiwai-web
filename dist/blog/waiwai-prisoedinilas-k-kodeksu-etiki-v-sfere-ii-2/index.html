        <p>Startup WaiWai became a participant in the Code of Ethics in the field of artificial intelligence. By doing this, we emphasize our responsibility to clients and society as a whole.</p>
<p>The Code of Ethics is designed to create an environment for trusted development of artificial intelligence technologies in Russia. Joining the Code is voluntary.</p>
<p>Main objectives of the Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protection of human rights - reducing risks of unethical AI use that could violate people's rights and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methodological support - providing recommendations for making ethical decisions when creating and using AI technologies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Significance for WaiWai</p>
<p>WaiWai's AI agents process information about potential clients, search for leads, and conduct business communication. Working with such data requires a high level of responsibility. Joining the Code reinforces the company's commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use only open data sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with principles of confidentiality and personal data protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop technologies aimed at business development without using manipulative practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure transparency of algorithms and system operating methods</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following ethical principles is the foundation for building long-term trusting relationships with clients and sustainable business development.</p>
<p>About the Code</p>
<p>The AI Ethics Code was developed by the Alliance in the field of artificial intelligence with participation from leading Russian technology companies, scientific organizations, and the expert community. The document was created as an industry self-regulation tool and applies to civilian developments.</p>
