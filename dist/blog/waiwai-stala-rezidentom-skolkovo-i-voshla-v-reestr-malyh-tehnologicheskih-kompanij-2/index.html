        <p>WaiWai, which started by developing two specialized AI agents for recruitment and B2B sales automation, announces a new stage of development. The startup has <a href="https://navigator.sk.ru/orn/1127659" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> resident status at the Skolkovo Innovation Center and joined the Registry of Small Technology Companies (STC) of Russia.</p>
<h2>From Point Solutions to an Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Having successfully tested its AI solutions with clients such as Ak Bars Bank, delivery service Falcone, IT conferences Ontico, and T-Bank, WaiWai is transforming into a full-fledged marketplace of AI employees.</p>
<p>The idea is that companies will be able to install ready-made digital salespeople, recruiters, support specialists, and document management staff as easily as mobile applications.</p>
<p>"We started by solving specific problems - helping businesses find clients and fill vacancies using AI. Seeing the results, we realized that the market needs an entire ecosystem of such solutions. Skolkovo resident status and inclusion in the STC registry is recognition of our technological potential and support for further scaling," comments WaiWai founder Mik Weisman.</p>
<h2>Technological Advantages</h2>
<p>A key feature of the WaiWai platform is that all AI employees work with unified local organizational memory, learn from internal company data, and share context with each other. This eliminates tool fragmentation and ensures corporate data confidentiality.</p>
<p>The platform also supports publishing third-party AI employees via JSON manifest, allowing the formation of a marketplace of solutions from Russian and international developers.</p>
<h2>Recognition and Prospects</h2>
<p>WaiWai's pilot project with Ak Bars Bank for implementing an AI recruiter has already received the industry "AI Olympus" award at Digital Leaders 2025 as the best HR-AI project.</p>
<p>The company's target market is B2B segments with high volumes of routine operations and data: fintech, e-commerce, logistics, banks. The company plans to develop the marketplace in Russia, CIS markets, and fast-growing MENA and Asian economies, where demand for business process automation is rapidly growing.</p>
