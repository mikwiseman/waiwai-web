        <p>WaiWai hosted the WaiHack hackathon for developing AI agents. It became a study of how realistic AI agent applications are across different fields.</p>
<p>48 people registered for the hackathon. 7 teams made it to the pitch. Over the weekend, participants needed to create a working prototype. The teams mainly consisted of product managers, developers, and experts in fields such as investments, tourism, agriculture, interior design, and finance.</p>
<p>The jury had a very difficult choice because all the projects at the pitches were creative, and many had excellent technical execution.</p>
<p>AI agents were evaluated across three categories: prototype development, user value, and level of API/SDK/tool integration.</p>
<p><strong>The hackathon winners were:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1st place: Sexy Agent.</strong> The project connects startups and investors: it helps with pitch formation, economic model preparation, and sending recommendations to potential investors. The goal is to make fundraising easier and cheaper, and help investors find interesting projects.<br />
The team successfully combined their expertise in fundraising, PR, and development in this solution.</p>
<p><strong>2nd place: LagomDev.</strong> The project took the mundane topic of personal productivity and made it interesting through character image generation - adding a gamification element. This was one of the few projects that actually used multiple language models working together.</p>
<p><strong>3rd place: Loca.</strong> A highly personalized bot that, depending on preferences and location, suggests individual interesting events to visit or plans an entire trip. The idea was complemented by excellent positioning and fine-tuning - the bot's communication tone turned out light and memorable.</p>
<p>Sharing <strong>3rd place</strong> with Loca was the <strong>Fugarov's bot</strong>. It determines wall area from a photo, then calculates the amount of paint and wallpaper needed for finishing. The bot also selects a suitable shade.</p>
<p>Jury and mentors: Pavel Khmelinsky, CTO of the Commercial Division at Samolet Group, Sergey Ris, developer and vibe-coding expert, Ivan Yunitsky, co-founder of VOIC LAB.</p>
<p>Media partners were BangBang Education and <a href="http://fl.ru" rel="noopener noreferrer">fl.ru</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The next hackathon</strong> is planned for late October 2025, also online.</p>
