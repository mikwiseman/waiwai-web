        <h2><strong>What Are AI Agents?</strong></h2>
<p>AI agents are programs based on artificial intelligence capable of independently performing a wide range of tasks.</p>
<p>For more details on why this is one of the main trends among new technologies and why AI agents will soon appear in various sectors of the economy, you can read in <a href="https://aitoolz.ru/news/ai-agenty-ot-khajpa-k-realnym-biznes-instrumentam-stoimostyu-do-20-000-v-mesyats@215" rel="noopener noreferrer">our article</a> for <a href="http://Sostav.ru" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sostav.ru</a>'s Aitoolz project.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do AI Agents Find Clients?</strong></h2>
<p>Sales is a complex niche with a lot of routine work. That's why we developed an AI agent - the WaiWai system, which automates client search in the B2B sector. Guided by a given customer profile, it finds similar ones in open data sources and corresponds with them. The tool is designed to simplify the lead generation process, saving business time and resources.</p>
<h2>What Leads Can the System Find?</h2>
<p>Our system is capable of finding potential clients across a wide range of parameters. The main capability is search by professional characteristics.</p>
<p>The system's flexibility allows for both broad queries, such as "IT specialists in Russia," and highly specialized ones, such as "brokers in New York who speak Russian."</p>
<p>For example, we can search for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Representatives of specific positions: technical directors (CTO), marketing directors (CMO), financial directors, product directors, and business owners across various industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specialists in specific professions: C or Python developers, dentists, event organizers, logistics specialists, brokers, lawyers - the list goes on endlessly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People by additional criteria. For example, employees of companies of a certain size or specialists interested in edtech who have participated in relevant events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, the system allows narrowing the search by additional parameters, making it more effective. Such parameters can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location: for example, "technical directors in Berlin," "developers in Moscow," "dentists in St. Petersburg."</li>
<li>Educational background: where the potential client studied.</li>
<li>Workplace: company size, industry, specific organization.</li>
<li>Hobbies: can also be search parameters - from golf to numismatics.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>System Limitations: What AI Agents Cannot Find</strong></h2>
<p>Despite high efficiency, our system has certain limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data from closed sources</strong> The system works exclusively with legal open data sources. For example, we cannot:
<ul>
<li>Enrich data by phone number and full name</li>
<li>Use leaked databases or illegal information sources</li>
<li>Obtain information from closed government registries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our system is designed specifically for finding B2B clients.</li>
<li><strong>Technically impossible requests</strong><br />
There are requests that are impossible to fulfill in principle. For example - searching for companies that declared goods at customs (no open APIs available).</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time, some specific complex requests are feasible but require custom development. For example, searching for businesses with a legal entity in Russia but trading with Kazakhstan, using specific platforms.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The AI agent for B2B client search is a powerful tool for targeted prospecting. It allows you to quickly and efficiently find leads across a wide range of parameters while working exclusively with legal open data sources.</p>
<p>The system handles typical requests by position, location, and industry well, and offers custom solutions for particularly complex cases.</p>
