        <p>Like other tech optimists such as Sam Altman or Elon Musk, we believe that artificial intelligence will not replace people. AI is just another tool in human hands.</p>
<p>At the OpenAI forum "Making AI Work For Everyone," OpenAI's Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil gives an example of customer support functioning: AI handles 80% of standard requests, while people focus on the remaining 20% of cases requiring empathy and creativity. Stanford University Professor Erik Brynjolfsson argues that process automation will be carried out by AI agents working in copilot mode, i.e., under human guidance.</p>
<p>AI agents, which include WaiWai, are the next stage of large language model development. This is a new tool for business that can do incredible things, but you need to learn how to use it. This is how complex technologies are integrated into business. The same applies to comprehensive B2B sales automation.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>If a sales manager used to send ten business emails per hour, with WaiWai they can send two hundred of the same quality. The system finds clients and establishes initial contact with them, and the human takes over the dialogue at the right moment. Thus, WaiWai amplifies the manager's capabilities and accelerates their productivity.</p>
<p>WaiWai's sales experts and technical director work with you to create an ICP - Ideal Customer Profile. Based on the ICP, WaiWai engages in lead generation across numerous business information databases. We find some information through parsing and data enrichment from social networks.</p>
<p>The program consolidates the client list into a single database. As a result, we have: client names, their field of activity, information about the company they work for. All information is taken from open sources.</p>
<p>The next stage is creating personalized messages that take into account the user's interests and information collected by WaiWai. Emails can be sent through LinkedIn, email, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, and any other social networks.</p>
<p>This is how AI for sales removes routine tasks.</p>
<h2>What Involvement Is Required From You?</h2>
<p>As we said, AI works best in tandem with a human. The system needs to be guided and corrected; it needs our strategic thinking and our "nerve."</p>
<p>Therefore, during the process, we will need your understanding of your own product, your vision of potential clients, and your business specifics.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous generation of automation systems, WaiWai knows how to learn, and believe us, she will become your best student.</p>
<p>The collaboration recipe involves the following interaction:</p>
<p>- We call you every week, provide an analytical summary, look at statistics on how sales are going.</p>
<p>- You work with us to adjust:<br />
The ready ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)<br />
Lead selections<br />
Messages for them based on intermediate results.</p>
<p>This creates the formula IT + WaiWai + Sales:</p>
<p>1. You, who knows your product better than anyone else.</p>
<p>2. We are IT professionals who have also accumulated multi-faceted sales expertise.</p>
<p>3. WaiWai, which knows how to quickly and efficiently automate routine: finding clients and creating personalized messages.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The market doesn't stand still. Companies that are first to implement AI tools in their sales departments will gain a significant competitive advantage. WaiWai is not just technology, it's a strategic partner that will help you increase sales by freeing your sales managers from routine. This will allow them to focus on what they do best - closing deals.</p>
<p>Remember the famous phrase from Stanford: "While you sleep, your competitors are studying calculus." In the sales world, this can be rephrased as: "While you're looking for clients through cold calling, your competitors are already using AI."</p>
