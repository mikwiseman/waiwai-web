        <h3>WaiWai is a lead generation system for the B2B segment. We explain how WaiWai organizes the sales process - from finding and ranking clients to writing emails and systematizing results.</h3>
<p>1. Finding Clients</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, we work together with the client to create a clear image of the potential customer. <strong>Instead of dry technical specifications, we simply have a conversation with you to find out together who could become your ideal client.</strong> This live dialogue allows for more precise determination of what leads we're looking for. In parallel, we integrate WaiWai's analytical toolkit for target audience modeling.<br />
Key profile parameters include: position, location, industry, company size. These can also include hobbies, language skills, education, marital status, social media activity, job searching. This forms what we call the Ideal Customer Profile at WaiWai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, WaiWai begins searching in numerous business information databases. For example, these could be Apollo, ZoomInfo, or Wiza.<br />
We obtain some information ourselves through parsing from open sources. We also additionally enrich data, for example, from social networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Evaluating the Compiled Client List</h3>
<p>Having formed the final lead list, WaiWai ranks the database according to Ideal Customer Profile criteria. <strong>We write first to the most likely leads.</strong></p>
<p>We integrate with any possible CRMs: Amo CRM, Hubspot. WaiWai also integrates with Google Docs or Yandex Docs.</p>
<h3>3. Writing Emails to Clients</h3>
<p>Guided by the data set about each person individually, WaiWai sends personalized emails.</p>
<h3>4. Assisting the Sales Department</h3>
<p>WaiWai does everything to make the sales manager's job easier. The system can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compile questions for conducting calls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze managers' calls, for example, how well they followed the script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the sales department is overloaded with incoming customer requests and needs help - WaiWai sorts them and ranks by urgency. <strong>The system responds to clients automatically and can perform specified actions, for example - transferring requests to a partner network.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outbound assistance - if a sales manager wants to write to a specific company, WaiWai will find potentially interested people there. The system will collect information about potential clients and contact them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, WaiWai performs the work of an entire sales department - from targeted client search to assisting sales managers in closing deals.</p>
