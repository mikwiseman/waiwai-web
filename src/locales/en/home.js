    { number: 1, title: 'Ideas are the new bottleneck.', text: 'A hundred years ago we shifted from manual to machine labor. Now AI removes intellectual routine. Figuring out what to build and why — only we can do that.' },

    { number: 3, title: 'Speed over perfection.', text: 'From idea to working product — hours, not weeks. Ship first, polish later. Every week brings new models and tools — if you\'re not experimenting, you\'re falling behind.' },
    { number: 4, title: 'Measure everything.', text: 'Actions, decisions, results — all digital traces must be collected. Let agents analyze this data and learn from it. Set goals in numbers and constantly check progress.' },
    { number: 5, title: 'Build for people.', text: 'AI is a tool, not a goal. The question isn\'t "what can the technology do" but "what problem does it solve". A solved user problem is the ultimate measure of success.' },

    { number: 7, title: 'There are no universal rules.', text: 'Even these principles aren\'t universal. Compact teams augmented by AI, constant calibration — that\'s where we\'re heading. We\'ll figure out the rest along the way.' }
